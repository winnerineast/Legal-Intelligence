## Design Principle
1. to leverage some craw platform to harvest internet. [craw_management](https://github.com/winnerineast/crawlab)
2. to vectorize the data by pure coding.[vector](https://github.com/winnerineast/rag-from-scratch)
3. to have a Q & A UI with LLM to drill insights.[brain](https://github.com/winnerineast/quivr)
4. to act back to internet based on insight derived from above.[agents](https://github.com/winnerineast/crewAI)
