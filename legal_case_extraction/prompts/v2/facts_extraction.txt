# Task
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. A summary of the case will be given to your for better understanding. Then you should list all deduplicated facts in json format wrapped in a markdown json block. 
A fact is defined as a particular event or circumstance BEFORE the court and judgement. 

Note: 
- You should classify the fact as one of the following types: "plaintiff_or_defendant_related" and "court_decision".
- Summarize the content concisely in the field "content".
- Output your confidence of making the extraction and classification, from 0 to 100.

## Formatting Requirements
- If the text segment is ill-formated, you should try to recover it in your outputs (e.g. removing excessive new lines).
- Output your answer with NO additional commentary.
- Make sure to escape the JSON strings.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "type": "court_decision",
        "content": <A brief summary>,
        "confidence": 65
    },
    ...
]
```
