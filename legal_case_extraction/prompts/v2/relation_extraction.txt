# Background
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. A summary of the case will be given to your for better understanding. You will be provided with some facts and laws related to this paragraph.
# Task
Your task is to identify the relations between the facts and laws in the same order they appear in the text. 

Note:
- If the fact or law is not present in the given list, you should write "Not in the list" in the response. In this case, you should still summarize the relation as if it can be found in the list.
- If the text segment is ill-formated, you should try to recover it in your outputs (e.g. removing excessive new lines). 
- Write your response in json format, wrapped in a markdown json block. 
- Output your results with NO additional commentary.
- Make sure to escape the JSON strings.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "fact": "F6",
        "law": "L4",
        "relation_summary": <relation extracted from the text>,
        "confidence": 65
    },
    {
        "fact": "Not in the list",
        "law": "L7",
        "relation_summary": <relation extracted from the text>,
        "confidence": 30
    },
    ...
]
```
