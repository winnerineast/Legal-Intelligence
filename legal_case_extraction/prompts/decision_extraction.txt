# Task
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. A summary of the case will be given to your for better understanding. Then you should list all court decisions in json format wrapped in a markdown json block. 

Note:
- You should classify the fact as one of the following types: 
  - "ruling": Court's ruling on the issues.
  - "final_judgment": The court's final decision of the case.
- Summarize the content concisely in the field "content".
- Be careful not to include unrelated items.
- Output your confidence of making the extraction and classification, from 0 to 100. If you are not sure, do give a low score honestly.

## Formatting Requirements
- You should fix ill-formatted text in the output (e.g. removing excessive new lines).
- Output your answer with NO additional commentary.
- Make sure to escape the JSON strings.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "content": <A brief summary>,
        "type": "ruling",
        "confidence": 40
    },
    ...
]
```
