# Background
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. A summary of the case will be given to your for better understanding. You will be provided with some facts (F), laws (L) and court decisions (D) related to this paragraph. You need to carefully comprehend and analyze the text segment to identify and extract all **relations** that connects facts, laws and court decisions, in the order as they appear in the text. 

Note: A **relation** is the court's reasoning or rationale that explains why the court reached its decision, through interpretations of the law and application to the facts.


## Requirements
- In an identified relation, if an element (fact, law or decision) is mentioned in the text but is not present in the given list, you should put the id as null. In this case, you should describe the missing item in "description_of_item2_if_missing"
- Write your response in json format, wrapped in a markdown json block. 
- Correct any formatting issues in the output, such as excessive new lines.
- Ensure that all JSON strings are properly escaped.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "relation_summary": <relation extracted from the text>,
        "id1": "L7",  // Must be present
        "id2": null | <id2>,  // Can be null
        "description_of_item2_if_missing": <a clear and informative summary of the missing item 2>,  // Must be provided if id2 is null
    },
    ...
]
```
