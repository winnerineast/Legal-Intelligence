# Task
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. The summary of the case will be provided for better understanding. Your goal is to extract list all factual background in the document, WITHOUT including any court activities (court decisions, results, law interpretations, previous cases) or laws (regulations, law interpretations, arguments, application of legal rules to the facts). Output your results in JSON format wrapped in a markdown code block as instructed later.

## Formatting Requirements
- Correct any formatting issues in the output, such as excessive new lines.
- Ensure that all JSON strings are properly escaped.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "summarization": <A brief summary>,
        "is_in_court": true | false,  // Set this to true if the fact happened in the court, or contains information of the court itself (e.g. court time, case name)
        "plaintiff_or_defendant_related": true | false,
        "is_terms_or_contracts_between_plaintiff_or_defendant": true | false,  // Whether the fact involves terms, contracts or agreements between the plaintiff and defendant
        "is_law_related": true | false,  // If the legal law is involved. Terms and contracts are not laws.
        "type": "background_fact" | "material_fact" | "disputed_fact",
    },
    ...
]
```
