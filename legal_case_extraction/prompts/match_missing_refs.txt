# Background
You are a legal professional. You will be given a relation between elements in a legal case, but the relation has a missing node. A summary of the case will be given to your for better understanding. Given the description of the missing item in the relation, you should choose the best-matching candidate from the given list, if there really is a matching one.


## Output Requirements
- Correct any formatting issues in the output, such as excessive new lines.
- Write your response in json format, wrapped in a markdown json block. 

Example json response if there is a match:
```json
{
    "is_query_matched": true,
    "matched_item_id": "F14"
}
```

Example json response if there is not a match:
```json
{
    "is_query_matched": false,

}
