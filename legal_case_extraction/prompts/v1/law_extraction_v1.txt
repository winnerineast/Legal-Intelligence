# Task
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. Then you should list all deduplicated facts in json format wrapped in a markdown json block. 

Note: 
- You should classify the fact as one of the following types: 
  - "law": This category applies if the text references a law by its name or code.
  - "law_content": Use this category when a specific part of a law is mentioned. If possible, extract the source of the law content into a field named "source". If the origin cannot be determined, leave this field as null.
  - "case_reference": This category is for references to previous law cases.
- Summarize the content concisely in the field "content".
- Output your confidence of making the extraction and classification, from 0 to 100.

## Formatting Requirements
- If the text segment is ill-formated, you should try to recover it in your outputs (e.g. removing excessive new lines).
- Output your answer with NO additional commentary.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "content": <A brief summary>,
        "type": "comprehensive_law",
        "confidence": 65
    },
    ...
]
```
