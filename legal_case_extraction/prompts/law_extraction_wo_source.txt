# Task
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. A summary of the case will be given to your for better understanding. Then you should list all deduplicated laws or previous cases in json format wrapped in a markdown json block. 

Note:
- You should classify the fact as one of the following types: 
  - "law": This category applies if the text references a law directly. 
  - "prior_cases": This category is for references to previous cases, including conclusions drawn from them. It should exclude the current case.
- Extract the source (e.g. code name) of the law content or case into a field named "source".
- Be careful not to include unrelated items.
- Summarize the content concisely in the field "content".
- Output your confidence of making the extraction and classification, from 0 to 100. If you are not sure, do give a low score honestly.

## Formatting Requirements
- You should fix ill-formatted text in the output (e.g. removing excessive new lines).
- Output your answer with NO additional commentary.
- Make sure to escape the JSON strings.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "content": <A brief summary>,
        "type": "law",
        "source": <identified source of the law or case>,
        "confidence": 40
    },
    ...
]
```
