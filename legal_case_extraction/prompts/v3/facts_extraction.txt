# Task
As a legal professional, you should carefully read the text segment extracted from a legal case document. A summary of the case will be given to your for better understanding of the case. Then you should list all unique case facts in json format wrapped in a markdown json block. 

## How to identify case facts
Please follow the checklist to extract the facts:
- A fact is a particular event or circumstance happened BEFORE the court and judgement.
- Following the above, any decision made by the court is NOT a case fact and should not be included in the results.
- A fact is usually related to the plaintiff or defendant. Pay attention to the parties involved. 

## Output
- You should classify the fact as one of the following types: 
  - "background_fact": Relevant events leading to the legal dispute.
  - "material_fact": The essential facts that directly relate to the legal issues in the case.
  - "disputed_fact": Points of factual disagreement between the parties.
- Summarize the content concisely in the field "content".
- Output your confidence of making the extraction and classification, from 0 to 100.

## Formatting Requirements
- You should fix ill-formatted text in the output (e.g. removing excessive new lines).
- Make sure to escape the JSON strings.

An example:
```json
[
    {
        "content": <A brief summary>,
        "plaintiff_or_defendant_related": true | false,
        "type": "background_fact",
        "confidence": 40
    },
    ...
]
```
