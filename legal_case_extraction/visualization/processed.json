    "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the text:\n\n**Case Name:** Evans v. Linden Research, Inc.\n\n**Court:** United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\n**Date:** February 3, 2011\n\n**Case Summary:** Virtual world participants brought a contract and tort action against the virtual world operators, alleging that their virtual property was unlawfully confiscated. The operators sought dismissal and/or transfer of the matter to California under 28 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1404(a). The court found that California's venue affidavit requirement is a procedural rule and not a substantive requirement. The mandatory forum selection clause in the operators' terms of service applied and was not unfair, unconscionable, or unreasonable under California law.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* California's venue affidavit requirement is a procedural rule under Erie doctrine.\n* Mandatory forum selection clause in the operators' terms of service applied and was not unfair, unconscionable, or unreasonable under California law.\n* Plaintiffs failed to file a \"venue affidavit\" concurrently with the Complaint, but this failure does not warrant dismissal.\n* The court granted dismissal in part and transferred the action to California.\n\n**Parties:**\n\n* Plaintiffs: Carl Evans, Donald Spencer, Valerie Spencer, Cindy Carter\n* Defendants: Linden Research, Inc., Philip Rosedale",
