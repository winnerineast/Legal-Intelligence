The \noperators sought dismissal and/or transfer of the matter \nto California under 28 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1404(a). The court \nfound that as California's venue affidavit requirement in \nCal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1780(d) was a procedural rule, \ndismissal was not warranted. A mandatory forum \nselection clause in the operators' terms of service \napplied and was not unfair, unconscionable, or \nunreasonable under California law.\nOutcome\nDismissal granted in part; action transferred.\nLexisNexis\u00ae Headnotes\nAntitrust & Trade Law > Regulated \nPractices > Private Actions > State Regulation\nCivil Procedure > Dismissal > Involuntary \nDismissals > Failure to State Claims\nCivil \nProcedure > ... > Pleadings > Complaints > Require\nments for Complaint\nHN1[\n]  Private Actions, State Regulation\nTo bring an action under the California Consumer Legal \nRemedies Act, a plaintiff is required to file an affidavit \n\"concurrently with the filing of the complaint\" stating \nfacts showing that the action has been commenced in a \ncounty or judicial district described in this section as a \nproper place for the trial of the action.

First, a court must \ndetermine whether the state rule is in direct conflict with \na Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. If so, the Federal \nRule prevails. However, if there is no direct conflict, the \ncourt considers the \"twin aims\" of the Erie doctrine: \ndiscouragement of forum shopping and avoidance of \ninequitable administration of the laws. The Supreme \nCourt has added two qualifications to the Erie analysis. \nFirst, a strong federal interest may dictate the \napplication of the federal rule. Second, the Erie doctrine \ncannot be used to avoid a Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure.\nPage 2 of 7\n \nAntitrust & Trade Law > Regulated \nPractices > Private Actions > State Regulation\nCivil \nProcedure > ... > Pleadings > Complaints > Require\nments for Complaint\nHN3[\n]  Private Actions, State Regulation\nCalifornia's venue affidavit requirement in Cal. Civ. \nCode \u00a7 1780(d). is a procedural rule. Although there is \nno direct conflict with a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \nor a local rule, the venue affidavit requirement asks \nplaintiffs to provide additional venue materials that \nfederal courts do not. Ultimately, the venue affidavit \nrequirement is procedural (regardless of a conflict) \nbecause application of the requirement does not have a \nsignificant impact on the outcome of the case. Under the \nrequirement, the only penalty for failing to provide the \naffidavit is to have the claim dismissed without \nprejudice.\nBusiness & Corporate Compliance > ... > Contracts \nLaw > Contract Conditions & Provisions > Forum \nSelection Clauses\nEvidence > Burdens of Proof > Allocation\nHN4[\n]  Contract Conditions & Provisions, Forum \nSelection Clauses\nUnder federal law, to show that a valid forum selection \nclause is not enforceable, plaintiffs' must make a strong \nshowing that: (1) the forum selected is \"so gravely \ndifficult and inconvenient\" that the party will for all \npractical purposes be deprived of his day in court; or (2) \nthe \nclause \nwas \nprocured \nthrough \n\"fraud \nand \noverreaching.\"\nBusiness & Corporate Compliance > ... > Contracts \nLaw > Contract Conditions & Provisions > Forum \nSelection Clauses\nCivil Procedure > Preliminary \nConsiderations > Federal & State \nInterrelationships > General Overview\nContracts \nLaw > Defenses > Unconscionability > General \nOverview\nHN5[\n]  Contract Conditions & Provisions, Forum \nSelection Clauses\nA forum selection clause may be unenforceable where it \nis found to be unconscionable.

Thus, \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss is granted in part and \ndenied in part, and the case will  [**5] be transferred to \nthe Northern District of California.\nII. BACKGROUND\nDefendants are operators of Second Life, a virtual \nworld, and Plaintiffs were participants. In this virtual \nworld participants create avatars and their avatars have \nfriendships, make contracts, etc. Participants were given \n\"discouragement of forum shopping and avoidance of \ninequitable administration of the laws.\" Hanna, 380 U.S. at \n468. The Supreme Court has added two qualifications to the \nErie analysis. First, a strong federal interest may dictate the \napplication of the federal rule. Second, the Erie doctrine \ncannot be used to avoid a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. \nSee Chamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir. \n2000) citing Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Coop., Inc., 356 \nU.S. 525, 538, 78 S. Ct. 893, 2 L. Ed. 2d 953 (1958); Hanna, \n380 U.S. at 470.\nHN3[\n] California's venue affidavit requirement is a \nprocedural rule. Although there is no direct conflict  [**4] with a \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure or a local rule, the venue \naffidavit requirement asks Plaintiffs to provide additional venue \nmaterials that federal courts do not. Ultimately, the venue \naffidavit requirement is procedural (regardless of a conflict) \nbecause application of the requirement does not have a \nsignificant impact on the outcome of the case. Under the \nrequirement, the only penalty for failing to provide the affidavit \nis to have the claim dismissed without prejudice. Thus, \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss Count I of Plaintiffs' Complaint \nwill be denied.\n2 Defendants argue in the alternative that if the Court denies \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, this \ncase should be transferred to the Northern District of California \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). As the Court finds that the forum \nselection clause applies in this case and as the Court is \ntransferring the case to the Northern District of California, this \nargument is moot.\nthe opportunity to buy and sell virtual goods including \nvirtual land. Plaintiffs allege that Linden and Rosedale \nadvertised the idea that the virtual property rights of \nparticipants were going to be protected. Plaintiffs \ncontend that Defendants unlawfully confiscated their \nvirtual property and denied them access to their virtual \nworlds.\nPlaintiffs brought their complaint to this Court on April \n15, 2010, and their amended complaint on June 16, \n2010. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves \nand all others similarly situated, seeking to establish a \nclass action. Plaintiffs allege these counts: (1) violation \nof the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, (2) \nviolation of the California False Advertising Law (Cal. \nBus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17500), (3) violation of California \nCivil Code \u00a7 1812.600, (4) violation of the California \nUnfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 \n17200), (5) Fraud/Fraud  [**6] in the Inducement, (6) \nConversion, (7) Intentional Interference with Contractual \nRelations/Prospective Economic Advantage, (8) Unjust \nEnrichment, (9) Wrongful Expulsion.\nOn July 9, 2010, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss \narguing that the forum selection clause of their terms of \nservice require Plaintiffs to file in the Northern District of \nCalifornia. \nSimultaneously, \nDefendants \nfiled \nan \nalternative Motion to Transfer arguing that this case \nshould be transferred to the Northern District of \nCalifornia under 1404(a).\nOn July 30, 2010, Plaintiffs filed their opposition to \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Transfer, \nsimultaneously raising a Motion for Leave to Conduct \nDiscovery. On September 2, 2010, Defendants filed a \nMotion for Leave to Reply Brief in Support of their \nMotions to Dismiss and Transfer.\nOn September 9, 2010, after a hearing on Defendants' \nMotion to Dismiss the Court ordered supplemental \nbriefing requesting the following information for each of \nPlaintiffs' Second Life accounts: (1) when the account \nwas opened; (2) what Terms of Service governed the \naccount when it was opened; and (3) if and when the \nPlaintiff later agreed to updated Terms of Service. \nDefendants  [**7] filed their supplemental briefing, \nproviding \nthe \nrequested \n [*739]  \ninformation, \non \nSeptember 30, 2010. Plaintiffs responded on October \n11, 2010. Defendants and Plaintiffs filed reply briefs on \nOctober 13, 2010 and October 15, 2010, respectively.\nIII. DISCUSSION\n763 F. Supp. 2d 735, *737; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11106, **3\nPage 5 of 7\n \nDefendants' move to dismiss for improper venue. They \nargue that the only Plaintiff that resides within this \nCourt's district is Carl Evans. Defendants argue that \nCarl Evans agreed to the newly revised Terms of \nService (TOS) that included a forum selection clause, \nrequiring Plaintiffs to bring suit in the Northern District of \nCalifornia. Defendants argue that the venue provision is \nvalid and enforceable. Defendants argue that TOSs that \nare offered on a \"take it or leave it basis\" are not de \nfacto unconscionable and that courts have upheld TOS \nagreed to in this manner. Defendants also argue that \nthe forum selection clause is not substantively \nunconscionable.\nPlaintiffs respond by first arguing that the new TOS \nwhich includes the forum selection clause may not apply \nto certain members of the proposed class and certain \naccounts of each member. Further, for the accounts \nwhere the new TOS does not apply, the Court's \nprevious decision in Bragg  [**8] v. Linden 3 applies to \nshow that the TOS was unenforceable because it was \nunconscionable under California law. 487 F. Supp. 2d \n593 (E.D. Pa. 2007)(Robreno, J.). Plaintiffs also argue \nthat the new TOS with the forum selection clause is \ninvalid as it is unconscionable under California law. \nThey argue that the new TOS is unconscionable \nbecause it was offered on a \"take it or leave it basis.\"\nHN4[\n] Under federal law, to show that a valid forum \nselection clause is not enforceable, Plaintiffs' must make \na strong showing that (1) the forum selected is \"so \ngravely difficult and inconvenient\" that the party \"will for \nall practical purposes be deprived of his day in court\" or \n(2) the clause was procured through \"fraud and \noverreaching.\" Foster v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., 933 F.2d \n1207, 1219 (3d Cir. 1991)(quoting M/S Bremen v. \n3 In Bragg, Plaintiff alleged similar claims, that Linden and \nRosedale had unlawfully confiscated his virtual property. \nBragg, 487 F. Supp. 2d 593. The Court was asked to \ndetermine whether or not the Plaintiff could file in this \njurisdiction because Plaintiff had signed Defendants' Terms of \nService (TOS) that included a mandatory arbitration clause \nthat required the Pennsylvanian Plaintiff to arbitrate in \nCalifornia (Defendants' state of residence).\nThe Court applied California law and found that the arbitration \nclause of the governing TOS was invalid because enforcing \nthe arbitration clause would be both procedurally and \nsubstantively \nunconscionable. \nThus, \nthe \nclause \nwas \nunenforceable, allowing Plaintiff to continue his action in this \nCourt. The Court denied both Defendants' Motion to Dismiss \nfor Lack  [**9] of Jurisdiction and Motion to Compel Arbitration.\nZapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 15, 92 S. Ct. 1907, \n32 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1972)). Here, Plaintiffs do not meet \nthis standard as they do not show how applying the \nforum selection clause will \"deprive[ them] of [thier] day \nin court\" or that the Defendants acted fraudulently when \nobtaining Plaintiffs' consent to the forum selection \nclause.\nHowever, HN5[\n] a forum selection clause may be \nunenforceable where it is found to be unconscionable. \nAlthough federal law is applied to determine whether or \nnot to give effect to a forum selection clause, Jumara v. \nState Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 877 (3d Cir. 1995), \nstate law may apply when evaluating whether or not the \nterms \nof \nthe \ncontract \nare \nunenforceable \nas \nunconscionable. Feldman v. Google, Inc., 513 F. Supp. \n2d 229, 235 (E.D. Pa. 2007).\nHN6[\n] Under  [**10] California law, terms of a contract \ncan be procedurally and/or substantively  [*740]  \nunconscionable. \"The procedural component can be \nsatisfied by showing (1) oppression through the \nexistence of unequal bargaining positions or (2) surprise \nthrough hidden terms common in the context of \nadhesion contracts.\" Bragg, 487 F.Supp. 2d at 605 \n(citing Comb v. Paypal, Inc., 218 F. Supp. 2d 1165, \n1172 (N.D. Cal. 2002)). \"The substantive component \ncan be satisfied by showing overly harsh or one-sided \nresults that 'shock the conscience.'\" Id. \"The two \nelements operate on a sliding scale such that the more \nsignificant one is, the less significant the other need be.\" \nId.\nHN7[\n] \"Under California law, the critical factor in \nprocedural unconscionability analysis is the manner in \nwhich the contract or the disputed clause was presented \nand negotiated.\" Bragg, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 606 (citing \nNagrampa v. MailCoups, Inc., 469 F.3d 1257, 1282 (9th \nCir. 2006)). Here, Plaintiffs had to accept the TOS on a \n\"take it or leave it\" basis, with no reasonable market \nalternatives because Second Life was the first and only \nvirtual world to grant its users property rights at the time.\nDefendants argue that a \"take it or leave it\" basis \n [**11] for accepting the terms alone does not make the \nnew TOS de facto unconscionable. Defendants point to \ncases involving similar selection clauses have upheld, \nwhen applying California law, similar forum selection \nclauses. See e.g., Nazaruk v. eBay, No. 2:06CV242, \n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66430, 2006 WL 2666429 (D. \nUtah Sept. 14, 2006); Person v. Google, 456 F.Supp.2d \n488 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). However, these cases are not \nbinding on this Court. Also, Defendants cite to Third \n763 F. Supp. 2d 735, *739; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11106, **7\nPage 6 of 7\n \nCircuit and Eastern District of Pennsylvania opinions \nthat have upheld \"click-through venue provisions\" but \nthese cases are not applying California law. See e.g., \nSchwartz v. Comcast Corp., No.06-4855, 256 F. App'x \n515 (3d Cir. Nov. 30, 2007).\nThere appears to be at least some level of procedural \nunconscionability due to the nature of the power \ndynamic between the parties and the lack of negotiation. \nHowever, HN8[",

Thus, it is clear that \nby clicking \"I Agree,\"  [**14] the user is knowingly \nagreeing to be bound by the forum selection clause.\nMoreover, the TSO contains an arbitration option which \nreads:\n[F]or any claim related to this Agreement or our \nService, excluding claims for injunctive or other \nequitable relief, where the total amount sought is \nless than ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000 USD), \neither we or you may elect at any point in or during \na dispute or proceeding to resolve the claim \nthrough binding non-appearance-based arbitration. \n. . . [T]he arbitration shall be conducted at the \noption of the party seeking relief, by telephone, \nonline or based solely on written submissions. . . . \n[T]he arbitration shall not involve any personal \nappearance by the parties or witnesses unless \notherwise mutually agreed by the parties. . . [A]ny \njudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator \nmay be entered in any court of competent \njurisdiction.\n(TOS \u00a7 12.1, Def. Ex. 1:B-2 at 2.)\nIn Bragg, where the Court found the arbitration clause \nunconscionable, the arbitration clause 4 was mandatory \n4 In Bragg, the arbitration clause of the TOS at issue provided:\nAny dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with \nthis Agreement or the performance, breach or termination \nthereof, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in \nSan Francisco, California under the Rules of Arbitration \nof the International Chamber of Commerce by three \narbitrators appointed in accordance with said rules.\nBragg, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 604.\n763 F. Supp. 2d 735, *740; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11106, **11\nPage 7 of 7\n \nno matter the size of the claim and required the claimant \nto appear in San Francisco for a hearing on the claim. \nBy contrast, the arbitration clause in Linden's current \nTOS  [**15] gives the claimant 5 the option for claims \nunder $10,000 to proceed to arbitration and to have the \nclaim heard by telephone, on-line, or by written \nsubmission, without having to appear in San Francisco. \nAlso under the current TOS, for any claim of $10,000 or \nmore, the claimant retains the right to proceed in Court \nand is not compelled to go to arbitration as in Bragg.\nFurther, where the arbitration clause in Bragg required \na panel of three arbitrators and arbitration pursuant to \nthe procedures of the International Chamber of \nCommerce, the current TOS requires only that the party \ninitiating arbitration do it \"through an established \nalternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\") provider mutually \n [**16] agreed upon by the parties.\" (TOS \u00a7 12.1, Def. \nEx. 1:B-2 at 2.) In light of these circumstances, 6 the \nforum selection clause  [*742]  of Linden's new TOS is \nnot unfair or unconscionable.\nFinally, to determine whether Linden's current TOS \napplied to each Plaintiff, the parties were asked to \nprovide supplemental briefing regarding each account \nheld by the Plaintiffs and which TOS each account had \nagreed too. The information provided shows that each \nPlaintiff agreed to the March, 2010 TOS at some point \nbefore this action was brought. Thus, the forum \nselection clause requiring that any  [**17] cases brought \nagainst the Defendant be brought in the Northern \nDistrict of California is enforceable as to all Plaintiffs in \nthis case.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendants' Motion to \nDismiss is granted in part and denied in part. The \n5 Linden also retains the option to demand arbitration of claims \nunder $10,000.\n6 If the claimant decides to proceed in Court, under the new \nTOS, California law will apply and the litigation must be \nbrought in San Francisco. Given that Linden operates \nnationwide, Linden has a legitimate business interest in \nuniform application of the law and in centralizing litigation in \none location. This dual purpose is served by an agreement \nthat California law applies and that the litigation of claims over \n$10,000 take place in San Francisco. Moreover, the selection \nof California law is reasonable, given that Linden is located in \nCalifornia and that California law is in many ways a consumer-\nfriendly forum.\nmotion is granted in part as the forum selection clause \nwill be enforced as to all Plaintiffs. However, the motion \nis denied in part as the case will not be dismissed but \ninstead will be transferred to the Northern District of \nCalifornia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406. An appropriate \norder will follow.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 3rd day of February, 2011 for the \nreasons set forth in the Court's accompanying \nmemorandum dated February 3, 2011, it is ORDERED \nthat:\n1. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (doc. no. 11) is \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Defendants' \nmotion will be granted as the Court finds that the forum \nselection clause applies so that the case cannot be \npursued in this Court. Defendants' motion is denied in \npart as the case will not be dismissed but transferred to \nthe United States District Court for the Northern District \nof California.\n2. The Clerk of the Court shall TRANSFER the case to \nthe United States District Court for the Northern \n [**18] District of California.\n3. Defendants' motions for leave to file replies (doc. nos. \n16 & 26) are GRANTED.\n4. Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended \nComplaint (doc. no. 13) will be DENIED as moot.\nAND IT IS SO ORDERED.\n/s/ Eduardo C. Robreno\nEDUARDO C. ROBRENO, J.\nEnd of Document\n763 F.
